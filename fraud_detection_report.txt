CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION - PROJECT REPORT
============================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection (Kaggle)
- Total Transactions: 284,807
- Fraud Rate: 0.17%
- Features: 30 (including engineered features)

MODEL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
----------------------------------------
LR_Original              : 0.9573
LR_SMOTE                 : 0.9698
LR_Under                 : 0.9760
XGB_Original             : 0.9652
XGB_SMOTE                : 0.9792
XGB_Final                : 0.9834
Autoencoder              : 0.9653

BEST MODEL: XGB_Final
BEST AUC SCORE: 0.9834

KEY INSIGHTS:
- Class imbalance was the primary challenge (99.83% normal, 0.17% fraud)
- SMOTE oversampling significantly improved model performance
- Feature scaling was crucial for model convergence
- Real-time processing capability demonstrated (100ms per transaction)

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Can process 600 transactions per minute in real-time
- High fraud detection rate with manageable false positive rate
- Potential savings: Millions in prevented fraudulent transactions

NEXT STEPS:
1. Deploy model to production environment
2. Implement model monitoring and retraining pipeline
3. A/B test against existing fraud detection system
4. Collect feedback for continuous improvement
